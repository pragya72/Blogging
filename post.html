				<h2>Baddha Konasana</h2>
				<p>From sitting position with both the legs outstretched forward, hands by the sides, 
                    palms resting on the ground, fingers together pointing forward, the legs are hinged at
                     the knees so the soles of the feet meet. The legs are grasped at the ankles and folded
                      more until the heels reach the perineum. The knees move down to the ground,
                     and with practice reach there; the body is erect and the gaze in front.</p>

				<h2>Vajrasana</h2>
				<p>The practitioner sits on the heels with the calves beneath the thighs. 
                    There is a four finger gap between the kneecaps,
                    and the first toe of both the feet touch each other and sit erect.</p>

				<h2>Halasana</h2>
				<p>The pose is entered from Sarvangasana (shoulderstand), lowering the
                 back slightly for balance, and moving the arms and legs over the head
                until the outstretched toes touch the ground and the fingertips, 
                in a preparatory variant of the pose. The arms may then be moved to 
                support the back into a more vertical position, giving a second variant
                pose. Finally, the arms may be stretched out on the ground away from the
                feet, giving the final pose in the shape of a traditional plough.</p>

				<h2>Sarvangasana</h2>
				<p>Shoulderstand is entered from a supine position with the knees bent. The shoulders
                may be supported on folded blankets, and the upper arms may be held in with a belt just 
                above the elbows. Beginners may lift with bent legs, advanced users with straight legs. 
                The back is supported by the hands: once up, the hands reach lower down the trunk towards 
                the head, and the trunk is lifted further; the legs may then be straightened to a vertical 
                position </p>
